# DEMO, FOR ME !

In case you've been living away from newspapers,
 there has been combat on multiple fronts around my
  nation for over one calendar year; Israel has invaded
 Gaza, plans to invade towards Beirut, and has even triggered
  Iranian responses from targeted strikes near Damascus.
 Without expressing any EXPLICATE SUP0prt for Israel's defensive
  and offensive actions, I must simply proclaim that the
 reprecussions of this Levantine conflict are not pleasing
  to me, in any way; local police consider me worse than
   useless, and the military has forgotten my service...
 so it goes!

## Purpose

This repository will include tools for being less
 of a useless callous shit about Israel's wars.

## Warranty

This code will not help return prisoners of war;
 it might keep me from killing myself, if it does
  what I want. I hope it will be useful for people
 beyond only myself, although I doubt this will help
  bring peace.... go throw your coins in some sacred
 well, unless you have `HTML5` on your business card.

## Contributing

If you have never contacted me before, please use Issues
 for explaining why you think collaboration is a good idea.
  If you have military rank of any kind, please include this
 information, as it might save us both lots of time. If you've
  ever interacted with me in any way other than only communications
 about code in this website, please consider contacting me by means
  other than Issues on this repository.

# ARE YOU HAPPY?

In case you have any friends, young or bold, new or old,
 who are at risk of getting killed involuntarily, please
  worry about how you can be happy despite this insane
 condition of the world.

I don't bother my friends because they don't bother me,
 and some of them might already be dead. The tool I will
  build might notify me, after enough time that I won't
 bother their families, either; it would not do any good.

## Org-Mode

Please consider whether orgmode would be superior to markdown.
